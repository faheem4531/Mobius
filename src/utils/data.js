      overview:
        "The project was to design a gel dispenser for an autonomous sonobot to do sonographs on patients. We worked on the  concept designs to achieve the desired results and also worked in parallel with Wosler engineering team to deliver DFM for the gel dispenser.",
      challenge:
        "The sonobot was an existing robot they had and to ensure that our gel dispenser goes smoothly with the bot we had to ensure compliance with the form factor and fittings to ensure that it feels like the part of a bot.",
      solution:
        "We came up with a dual stepper motor with two lead screws to achieve uniform delivery of the aquasonic gel. The front loading door was easy to use and the design of anti-drip valve cap helped to ensure there's no dripping of gel due to gravity.",
